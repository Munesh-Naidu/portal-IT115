       <p>Hello my name is Munesh and I am 19 years old. I am currently an emerging professional in the Seattle tech industry. I live in Kent which is a city outside of Seattle in Washington. Since I was kid I've 
           played video games, from Pokemon to Call of Duty to Elden Ring. This is what sparked my passion to be in the tech industry. I want tobe able to see, understand and write code that 
           goes into any of those games. I have slowly learned different types of code, I already kno C+, Python and some of Jave while currently learning HTML.</p>
       
       <p>I am currently a student at Year Up, Year up is a non-profit organization where the goal is too close the opputunity divide and help young adults take the first steps into the corporate industry.
           Year Up has two phases Learning & Development and Internship, each phase is 6 months long. I am in the Learning & Development phase right now where we are learning the hard and soft skills to be
           successful.
       </p>
       
       <p>My work background is pretty small, I have worked two jobs. My first job was guest service at Target which I worked at for about a year. Right now I am working as a Sales Asscociate at
           CarMax. I've been working at CarMax since August of 2021, I have learned a lot of skills while working there. I learned how to use Salesforce while at CarMax, I have also learned how to work
           as team with my fellow Sales Asscociates. My speaking skills have also grown while at working there talking to lots of customer with different backgrounds.
       </p>
       
       <p>My family and I are from the Fiji islands. My parents moved to Washington to give my sisters and I better oppurtunities. This makes me a first generation college student, I also have a highschool
           degree. With my parents giving me better oppurtunities I am looking to continue my education after Year Up and pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. </p>
